== Kuberspring

A workbench project to tinker with Spring Boot 2, Kotlin, Gradle and Kubernetes.

=== Use Minikube Docker

When using Minikube you may want to use the docker installation that comes with Minikube. This way you don't need to
deploy the image to a registry.

Execute the following command in the shell before running `gradle buildImage`:

----
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
----

=== Used Gradle-Plugins
